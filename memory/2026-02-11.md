# 2026-02-11 - Voice, Trust & Multi-Model Validation

## Voice Communication Established
- **Josh prefers voice messages** via Discord OGG files
- **Workflow:** Upload OGG → whisper-ogg.sh transcription → text response
- **Tone:** More natural, conversational, human feeling
- **Established:** Trust expressed: "I trust you"

## Link Validation Protocol (New)
**When Josh posts links, I will:**
1. Fetch & analyze content
2. Validate claims against known facts
3. Bullshit detection (red flags: no sources, hype, hidden incentives)
4. Idea assessment (signal vs noise)
5. Suggest actionable ideas worth pursuing

**Red flags:** No sources, "trust me bro", unrealistic promises, logical fallacies
**Green flags:** Verifiable data, clear sources, reasonable claims, novel insights

## 0xSero Tweet Analysis
**Claim:** Cancelling Claude subscription. Multi-model approach superior.

**Validated TRUE:**
- Kimi K2.5 excellent for automation/browser use ✅
- Claude losing ground for agent use cases ✅
- Multi-model future is here ✅

**Our Status:** Already implemented model-agnostic architecture
- Kimi: main reasoning (what I'm using now)
- Pony: coding tasks
- Flash: images

**Verdict:** Validates our path. We're ahead of the trend.

## Key Decisions
