## Durable Memory Flush (2026-02-09)

### System Hardening & Cleanup
- **Voice Rule Implemented:** New rule added to SOUL.md to always respond in voice when Korben sends voice. Test successful.
- **Backup System Hardened:** Switched backup script (`backup-leeloo.sh`) to ZIP/restore format with aggressive retention (7 daily, 12 hourly). Backup integrity verified via test extraction of `leeloo-latest.zip`. Changes committed to Git main branch (commit fdd2576).
- **Workspace Cleaned:** Removed test game directories and unused `leeloo-watcher` skill. `README.md` added with setup instructions.
- **Model Clarity:** Confirmed current running models: StepFlash (main chat), Pony Alpha (subagents), Gemini Flash (vision), ensuring optimization for context limits.

### Pixel Game Status
- Game remains tuned for ~10-minute demo completion time.

### Next Planned Phase (Awaiting Directive)
- Test game/backup restore, or proceed to Crypto Monitoring Agent configuration.
