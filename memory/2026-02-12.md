# Token Launch - Feb 12, 2026

## System Recovery - Afternoon Session

### What Was Broken & Fixed
1. **Multiple gateway processes** - Old processes (pid 10277, 10276) from 2:24 PM were still running, conflicting with new restarts
2. **Port 18789 blocked** - Old gateway holding port, preventing clean restart
3. **Backup system down** - Last backup was 12:16, cron jobs weren't running
4. **Config bloat** - 20+ model aliases, unused providers, invalid plugins
5. **Security issues** - Config was world-readable (644), credentials dir open (755)

### Fixes Applied
- Killed all old OpenClaw processes
- Freed port 18789
- Cleaned config: only kimi + local ollama, removed all bloat
- Set secure permissions: config 600, credentials 700
- Added backup cron jobs (hourly + daily)
- API key moved to secure file
- Gateway now runs clean on local mode

## Priority Tasks
- [ ] Smart contract final review (spawn Sentinel)
- [ ] Launch announcement drafts (spawn Herald)
- [ ] Community sentiment check (spawn Scout)
- [ ] Launch day timeline/coordination (spawn Quartermaster)

## System Status
- ✅ API key secured (moved to script)
- ✅ Duplicate cron jobs cleaned
- ✅ Team structure documented
- ✅ Backups running (hourly + daily)

## Ready to Spawn
1. **Sentinel** - Code review
2. **Herald** - Comms drafting
3. **Scout** - Research/monitoring
4. **Quartermaster** - Operations

## Notes
- User wants optimized system for token launch
- 4 specialized agents ready to deploy
- Direct communication preferred over spawning unnecessarily
