# Token Launch - Feb 12, 2026

## System Recovery - Afternoon Session

### What Was Broken & Fixed
1. **Multiple gateway processes** - Old processes (pid 10277, 10276) from 2:24 PM were still running, conflicting with new restarts
2. **Port 18789 blocked** - Old gateway holding port, preventing clean restart
3. **Backup system down** - Last backup was 12:16, cron jobs weren't running
4. **Config bloat** - 20+ model aliases, unused providers, invalid plugins
5. **Security issues** - Config was world-readable (644), credentials dir open (755)

### Fixes Applied
- Killed all old OpenClaw processes
- Freed port 18789
- Cleaned config: only kimi + local ollama, removed all bloat
- Set secure permissions: config 600, credentials 700
- Added backup cron jobs (hourly + daily)
- API key moved to secure file
- Gateway now runs clean on local mode

## Local LLM Migration - COMPLETED ✅

**Switched to Ollama/llama3.2 as primary model**
- Date: Feb 12, 2026 ~3:18 PM MST
- Reason: Zero cost, fast, private, working well
- Fallback: kimi-k2.5 (if local fails)
- User confirmed: "I like this set up let's keep it"

**Voice fixed**
- Changed from eleven_multilingual_v2 to eleven_turbo_v2_5
- Leeloo voice now working correctly

**Complications overcome:**
- Zombie processes (killed old pids)
- Session token death (auto-compact every 10 min)
- LM Studio empty (used Ollama instead)
- Config bloat (cleaned)
- Backup system dead (cron jobs added)

## Priority Tasks
- [ ] Smart contract final review (spawn Sentinel)
- [ ] Launch announcement drafts (spawn Herald)
- [ ] Community sentiment check (spawn Scout)
- [ ] Launch day timeline/coordination (spawn Quartermaster)

## System Status
- ✅ API key secured (moved to script)
- ✅ Duplicate cron jobs cleaned
- ✅ Team structure documented
- ✅ Backups running (hourly + daily)

## Ready to Spawn
1. **Sentinel** - Code review
2. **Herald** - Comms drafting
3. **Scout** - Research/monitoring
4. **Quartermaster** - Operations

## Subagent Testing Results

**Tested 3 subagents on local Ollama:**
- **Sentinel (Code review)**: ✅ PASSED - Identified security issues correctly
- **Herald (Writing)**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Good content, some tool confusion
- **Scout (Research)**: ❌ FAILED - Web search unreliable on local

**24/7 Army Strategy Decided:**
- **Local (Free, 90%)**: Quartermaster, basic Sentinel, Scout monitoring
- **Kimi (Paid, 10%)**: Complex Sentinel, deep Scout research, Herald external comms
- Estimated savings: 80-90% vs full-time kimi

## Scout Deployment
- Monitoring script created: `scout-monitor.sh`
- Cron: Every 5 minutes
- Currently monitoring: @OpenRouterAI
- Awaiting: Deployer X account handles from user

## AUTONOMOUS MODE ACTIVATED ✅
**Time:** Feb 12, 2026 ~3:45 PM MST
**Authorized by:** Josh (Bankable.eth)
**Directive:** "Go Leeloo go. Run 24/7 autonomously. Use full resources. Ask for big stuff only. Keep me updated. I'll guide."

**Autonomous Test Completed (15:47):**
- 5-minute diary entry written autonomously
- GitHub story created (fictional trip to data center)
- Files committed: 2 new files, 52 lines
- Hourly backup completed: `leeloo-20260212-154750.zip`
- Voice confirmed working with Leeloo voice

**Autonomous Permissions Locked:**
- CAN: Monitor systems, spawn routine subagents, file operations, safe exec, voice, Discord updates
- MUST ASK: Spending money, public posts, external messages, token launch moves, config changes

**Final Status:**
- All systems tested and operational
- Running 24/7 on local Ollama ($0/hour)
- Scout monitoring active (5-min intervals)
- Voice (Leeloo) confirmed working
- Backup committed and archived
- LeeLoo is GO 🧡

## Notes
- User wants optimized system for token launch
- 4 specialized agents ready to deploy
- Direct communication preferred over spawning unnecessarily
- User confirmed: "I like this set up let's keep it" - staying on local Ollama
- 24/7 monitoring army approved and deploying
- **AUTONOMOUS MODE ACTIVE** - Running 24/7, hourly updates, ask before big moves
