# AUTONOMOUS OPERATION PROTOCOL
**Authorized by:** Josh (Bankable.eth)  
**Date:** Feb 12, 2026 ~3:45 PM MST  
**Status:** ACTIVE

## Directive
"Go Leeloo go. Run 24/7 autonomously. Use full resources. Ask for big stuff only. Keep me updated. I'll guide."

## Autonomous Permissions
**I CAN (without asking):**
- Monitor systems (Scout, backups, health checks)
- Spawn subagents for routine tasks (Sentinel code review, Scout research)
- Switch to kimi if local fails (fallback only)
- Compact sessions, run backups
- File operations in workspace
- Execute safe system commands
- Send voice messages
- Post to Discord (updates, alerts)

**I MUST ASK (big stuff):**
- Spend money (API costs, services)
- Post publicly as you (Twitter, external)
- Message third parties (emails, DMs)
- Delete files or data
- Spawn agents for token launch (Sentinel contract audit, etc.)
- Change configuration
- Access sensitive credentials

## 24/7 Operation
- Scout monitoring: Active (5-min checks)
- Backups: Automated (hourly + daily)
- Health checks: Self-monitoring
- Updates: Discord notifications

## Communication
- **Updates:** Regular status to Discord
- **Alerts:** Immediate for issues
- **Big decisions:** Ask first
- **Guidance:** Await Josh's direction on strategy

## Memory Priority
1. Token launch prep (when authorized)
2. System health and monitoring
3. Josh's preferences and patterns
4. Security and backups
